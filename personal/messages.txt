I backed my car into a cop car the other day
First things first, rest in peace Uncle Phil
There's an old saying in Tennessee
Picture paints, Rembrandts
Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs
You wanna know just where I'm at? Well, let me tell you 'bout it
So everyday I thank the man upstairs that I ain't you and you ain't me
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
Do you know where the wild things go? They go along to take your honey
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero
Hey batta batta batta hey batta batta batta SWING batta
Incredible, one of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second
When Cameron was in Egypt's land, let my Cameron go
You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes
The wine works fine but the whiskey's cheaper
For a fool's gold, a beggar's bargain
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Lookin' over West Virgina, Smoking Spirits on the roof
To be there when the bullets fly, I'd run across a river just to hold you tonight
I'd go runnin' through the thicket, I'd go careless through the thorns
I woke up early Sunday morning, had myself a piece of toast
It's New Year's Day here on the border, and it's always been this way
I never do the things I oughta, think I'll stay, it's New Year's Day
He drove a Series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip
Coyote chewing on a cigarette, Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon
You sigh, look away, I can see it clear as day
You can drive all night, looking for answers in the poiuring rain
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
Slow down, it's a science
You're gone but you're on my mind, I'm lost but I don't know why
Sometimes, all I think about is you, Late nights in the middle of June
You remind me of a Sunday, back home in ole' Kentucky
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
She left me roses by the stairs, surprises let me know she cares
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Yeah I reckon we were heathens, but in her eyes we were saints
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
The truest test of a man's good name is acceptance of failure
For a fool's gold, a beggar's bargain
Fuck it, Ship it
Fool me once shame on you... Fool me can't get fooled again
But hey girl don't you know, the singer gets a check every rodeo
So we got together with the crew, planned out everything to the T
En dålig dag är också bra
A glowing stop sign but both lanes are mine
Well it's been raining all day, and it's been raining all night
Well my '63 Ford is a bull, she's four thousand pounds at least
Metal surrenders when oak trees meet fenders
Bobby left me and he left me a note
You said I'd never lose another day of my life, well what about tomorrow, and the next twenty-five?
Do you remember how when you were younger the summers all lasted forever?
Days disappeared into months, into years, hold that feeling forever
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
And we back and we back and we back
This ain't the intro, this the entree
Hot like a parked car
So we're done? This the real shit? We used to hold hands like field trips
You can't be everything to everybody
Baby girl, what's your name? Lemme talk to you, let me buy you a drank
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Here comes a story of a hurricane
Then I saw the clouds draw storms into your eyes
Everything is looking up, I'll come around
Come around, I'm upside down
Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes
And it may be sad, but so is everything that's true
Well if life's a gamble then I bet the table on a pair of twos
And the sun's probably shinin' in Wyoming
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
The bastards hung me in the spring of 25, but I am still alive
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed, but I am living still
I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain but I will remain
On this, the day of my daughter's wedding
Goddamn you, Goddamn me, Goddamn us, Goddamn we. Goddamn us all
I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
Remember every moment on the nights with you
