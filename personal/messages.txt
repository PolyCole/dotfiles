I backed my car into a cop car the other day
First things first, rest in peace Uncle Phil
There's an old saying in Tennessee
Picture paints, Rembrandts
Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs
You wanna know just where I'm at? Well, let me tell you 'bout it
So everyday I thank the man upstairs that I ain't you and you ain't me
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
Do you know where the wild things go? They go along to take your honey
There are strange things done in the midnight sun
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Ferris Bueller, you're my hero
Hey batta batta batta hey batta batta batta SWING batta
Incredible, one of the worst performances of my career and they never doubted it for a second
When Cameron was in Egypt's land, let my Cameron go
You're Abe Froman? The Sausage King of Chicago?
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes
The wine works fine but the whiskey's cheaper
For a fool's gold, a beggar's bargain
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Lookin' over West Virgina, Smoking Spirits on the roof
To be there when the bullets fly, I'd run across a river just to hold you tonight
I'd go runnin' through the thicket, I'd go careless through the thorns
I woke up early Sunday morning, had myself a piece of toast
It's New Year's Day here on the border, and it's always been this way
I never do the things I oughta, think I'll stay, it's New Year's Day
He drove a Series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip
Coyote chewing on a cigarette, Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon
You sigh, look away, I can see it clear as day
You can drive all night, looking for answers in the poiuring rain
And in the daylight we can hitchhike to Maine
Slow down, it's a science
You're gone but you're on my mind, I'm lost but I don't know why
Sometimes, all I think about is you, Late nights in the middle of June
You remind me of a Sunday, back home in ole' Kentucky
Leftover breakfast cereal for lunch
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
She left me roses by the stairs, surprises let me know she cares
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Yeah I reckon we were heathens, but in her eyes we were saints
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
